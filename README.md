# USC EE541-Deep-Learning
Welcome to the repository for my **Deep Learning (EE541)** assignments! All the assignments in this repo were coded using **Python**. Below, you'll find the relevant files for each assignment, including datasets and Jupyter notebooks.

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to the **Deep Learning (EE541)** assignments. These assignments cover various deep learning concepts, including neural networks, CNNs, ANNs, multi-layer perceptrons, clustering, and unsupervised learning, using popular Python libraries like **PyTorch**, **scikit-learn**, **NumPy**, etc.

## Assignments
### Assignment 1.3
- **Files**:
  - `func.py`: Contains the main functions for this assignment.
  - `EE541_HW-1_3.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for Assignment 1.3 with implementation and explanations.
  
This assignment involves building and training deep learning models for a specific task (e.g., classification, regression). The notebook includes detailed explanations of the model architecture, data preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.

### Assignment 2.1
- **Dataset**: `raman.txt`
  
This assignment uses the **raman.txt** dataset, which contains data for clustering tasks. The focus is on applying clustering algorithms like K-Means or hierarchical clustering to group the data based on its features.

### Assignment 2.2
- **Dataset**: `cluster.txt`
  
This assignment uses the **cluster.txt** dataset, where the task is to apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to categorize data points into clusters. The focus is on feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and cluster evaluation.
